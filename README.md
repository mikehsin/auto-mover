## üöÄ Quick Start

### Windows

1. **Prerequisites**: Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. **Build**: Run `build-scripts/build-windows.bat`
3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   cd windows
   dotnet run
   ```

### macOS

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

4. **Grant Permissions**: When prompted, grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility

## üéÆ Usage

### Windows (GUI)

- Launch the application to see a simple Windows Forms interface
- Click "Start" to begin automatic mouse movement
- Click "Cancel" to stop
- The application will move your mouse by 1 pixel every 30 seconds

### macOS (Console)

- Launch the application in Terminal
- Available commands:
  - `start` - Start the auto-mover
  - `stop` - Stop the auto-mover
  - `status` - Show current status
  - `help` - Show available commands
  - `quit` - Exit the application
- Press Ctrl+C to exit gracefully

## üîß Building from Source

### Windows

```bash
# Using modern .NET CLI (recommended)
cd windows
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run

# Using legacy batch script
build-scripts/build-windows.bat
```

### macOS

```bash
# Using shell script
./build-scripts/build-macos.sh

# Using .NET CLI directly
cd macos
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The default settings are:

- **Movement interval**: 30 seconds
- **Movement distance**: 1 pixel (random direction)
- **Boundary limits**: 2560x1440 (can be adjusted in code)

To modify these settings, edit the values in the respective `Program.cs` files.

## üîí Permissions

### Windows

- No special permissions required
- Uses standard Win32 API calls

### macOS

- Requires **Accessibility permissions**
- Uses Python with PyObjC for reliable mouse control
- System will prompt for permissions on first run

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Shared Core**: Common logic in `MouseAutoMoverCore.cs`
- **Platform Abstraction**: `IMouseMover` interface
- **Platform Implementations**: Separate classes for Windows and macOS
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking mouse movement with cancellation support

### Dependencies

- **.NET 8**: Cross-platform runtime
- **System.Drawing.Common**: For Point structures
- **Windows**: Win32 API (user32.dll)
- **macOS**: Python 3 with PyObjC for Quartz framework access

A simple Windows application that automatically moves your mouse cursor at user-defined intervals to keep your computer active and prevent it from going to sleep or showing as inactive.

## Features

- üñ±Ô∏è **Automatic Mouse Movement**: Moves the mouse cursor slightly (1-3 pixels) in random directions
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Customizable Interval**: Set any interval from 1 second to hours between movements
- üéÆ **Easy Controls**: Simple Start and Cancel buttons
- üîß **Settings Icon**: Clean interface with a gear/wrench icon
- üìä **Status Display**: Shows current status and last movement time
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Operation**: Keeps mouse movements within screen boundaries
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press Enter in the interval field to start quickly

## Screenshots

The application features a clean, user-friendly interface with:

- Movement interval input field (default: 30 seconds)
- Green "Start" button to begin auto-movement
- Red "Cancel" button to stop the process
- Status indicator showing current state
- Settings gear icon for visual appeal

## Installation

### Option 1: Use the Pre-built Executable

1. Download or locate `MouseAutoMover.exe`
2. Double-click to run (no installation required)

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or later installed
2. Run the build script:
   ```batch
   build_simple.bat
   ```
3. The executable `MouseAutoMover.exe` will be created

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Double-click `MouseAutoMover.exe`
2. **Set Interval**: Enter the desired number of seconds between mouse movements
3. **Start**: Click the "Start" button or press Enter
4. **Monitor**: Watch the status display for confirmation
5. **Stop**: Click the "Cancel" button when you want to stop

### Example Use Cases

- Prevent computer from going to sleep during presentations
- Keep status as "active" during work-from-home sessions
- Maintain connection to remote desktop sessions
- Prevent screensavers from activating during long processes

## Technical Details

### System Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework 4.0 or later
- No additional dependencies required

### How It Works

- Uses Windows API (`user32.dll`) for precise cursor control
- Generates random small movements (1-3 pixels)
- Respects screen boundaries to prevent cursor loss
- Lightweight application (< 11KB executable)

## Development

### Building from Source

The project includes two versions:

1. **Single File Version** (`MouseAutoMover_SingleFile.cs`):

   - All code in one file
   - Compatible with older .NET Framework compilers
   - Use `build_simple.bat` to compile

2. **Separated Version** (Multiple .cs files):
   - Standard Visual Studio project structure
   - Requires .NET 6 SDK or Visual Studio
   - Use `dotnet build` or Visual Studio

### Code Structure

- **Mouse Movement**: Uses `SetCursorPos` and `GetCursorPos` from Windows API
- **Timer Control**: Windows Forms Timer for interval management
- **Random Movement**: Random class generates small pixel offsets
- **UI Components**: Windows Forms with custom settings icon

## Safety and Privacy

- **No Network Activity**: Application works entirely offline
- **No Data Collection**: No user data is stored or transmitted
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Very low CPU and memory footprint
- **Reversible**: Stop anytime with the Cancel button
- **Non-Intrusive**: Mouse movements are barely noticeable (1-3 pixels)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application Won't Start**

- Ensure .NET Framework 4.0+ is installed
- Try running as administrator
- Check Windows Defender/antivirus settings

**Mouse Not Moving**

- Verify the interval is set to a positive number
- Check that "Start" button was clicked
- Ensure application has focus and isn't minimized

**Build Errors**

- Install .NET Framework Developer Pack
- Use `build_simple.bat` for older systems
- Check that Windows SDK is available

### Error Messages

- **"Invalid Input"**: Enter a positive number for interval
- **"Compiler not found"**: Install .NET Framework
- **"Access denied"**: Run with administrator privileges
